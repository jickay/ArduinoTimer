# ArduinoTimer

This project creates a kitchen timer using an Arduino Stitch Kid, Grove sound sensor, motion sensor, string of LED lights, and buzzer. It sets the timer by reading in sound input (claps) or motion, and sets time using LED lights. As time elapses, the lights start to dim. When all lights go out, the buzzer sounds, signifying the end of the timer.
